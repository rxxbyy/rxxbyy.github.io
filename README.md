# rxxbyy's personal text website
This is my personal text website. It is deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
on the URL [rxxbyy.netlify.app](https://rxxbyy.netlify.app).

## Coming soon
This is a work in progress. I'll be adding some cool features like:
* terminal theme selector
* interactiveness of the terminal trough some commands
* easter eggs
